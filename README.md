<h2>Description</h2>
To help stakeholders track updates in CRM sales records, I developed automated flows using Power Automate. These flows triggered email alerts or file updates based on changes in key CRM fields, improving visibility and follow-through in the sales process.
<br />

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- Microsoft Power Automate (flow creation)
- CRM system integration (Dynamics 365)
- Outlook email notifications
- SharePoint (logging)

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- Windows 11

<h2>Contributions </h2>

- Created flows to monitor updates to sales stage, revenue, and assigned rep
- Sent targeted notifications to sales leadership when records met alert conditions
- Logged each flow event to an Excel file for traceability
- Tested flows using dummy leads to ensure logic reliability

<h2>âœ… Outcome</h2>

- Reduced manual follow-ups on key accounts
- Improved CRM data reliability with timestamped change logs
- Empowered sales and support teams with real-time visibility
